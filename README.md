## Module Overview
In this assignment, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
